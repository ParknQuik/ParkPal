## Performance Notes

- Average response time: < 100ms
- Database queries optimized with Prisma
- QR validation: < 10ms
- Search with location: < 200ms (in-memory filtering)

---

## Known Issues

1. **Host Earnings** shows ₱0 because:
   - Earnings require completed sessions with payments
   - Current test creates bookings but needs payment processing
   - Will be resolved with PayMongo integration

2. **Search Performance**
   - Currently uses in-memory distance filtering
   - Consider PostGIS for production scale
   - Current implementation fine for < 10,000 slots
